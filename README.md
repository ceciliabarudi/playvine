web app for musicians to find sessions to participate, or create sessions to find other musicians to participate


## Description

Allows musicians to create gigs, or 'sessions', to which other musicians can apply to fulfill a needed role. For example, a singer looking for a guitarist for an upcoming concert can create a session and handle requests from applicants.
